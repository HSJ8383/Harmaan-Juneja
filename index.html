          <p>
            Hey there! I am Harmaan 👋. I am an Indian boy who lives in
            Shenzhen, China. My hobby is to play sports, football ⚽️ and
            cricket 🏏 . I am also interested in math 🧮, science 🔭, and coding
            🖥️. In coding, I have been learning about HTML and CSS for the past
            months. Over the years, my interest for Math ➕ and Science 👨‍🔬 has
            been majorly developing 📕 and I am very interested in learning
            various things in these topics 📚. I love to be energetic at all
            times, sitting idle always gets me bored 🫩. Whenever there is an
            activity which inclues a ball 🎾, it always catches my attention and
            I am recharged again ⚡️.

          <p>
            I have always loved football since the age of 8. I love this sport
            because I think that it is very engaging and it helps me improve my
            collaboration and awreness skills in the real world. I love many
            football teams, however, my favorite is definetely FC Barcelona. My
            favorite player and my football model is Lionel Messi because he
            shows the world that height or any physical disadvantage does not
            matter as long as you want to desperately achieve something.

          <p>
            I have always loved cricket since the age of 5. I love this sport
            because it always helps me to give my mind a focus-time so that my
            body can focus. Another skill that I have developed while playing
            cricket is collabartion skills as we always need to work in a team
            in-order to be successful. I love a lot of teams in the IPL,
            however, my favorite teams are Mumbai Indians, and Punjab Kings. My
            favorite cricket player is Virat Kohli because he shows his
            consistancy and composure in almost all of his matches. This shows
            that practice makes perfect.

            Ever since the age of 11, I have always wondered what exactly is
            coding. At that time, I just thought that it was about technology
            and how technologically robots and cars are made. But then, after a
            year, I started to have coding lessons. That's where I learned that
            coding is much more than what I thought, there were so many
            different levels of coding and everything had their own use. From
            then onwards, I loved coding and it became one of my main interests
            especially because I was able to solve my curiousity.
